Learning Github - Aug 13 2020

This is a practice Github repository

### Steps:  
- [ ] 1.) Fork this repository into your own account  
- [ ] 2.) Clone the forked copy of your repository to your local computer  
- [ ] 3.) Open the repository in your preferred text editor (I like Sublime)  
- [ ] 4.) Add an 'x' to the steps you've completed, and save  
- [ ] 5.) Add a commit message and 'Commit to master'  
- [ ] 6.) Push commit to Github. Do you see them reflected in your repository?  
- [ ] 7.) Open Project in R Studio  
- [ ] 8.) Create an R script file with some R code + save  
- [ ] 9.) Commit changes and push to Github
